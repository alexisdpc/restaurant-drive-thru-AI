I will open the file to check the available options and customize the order for you. Let's start by reviewing the file.

Based on the menu provided, you can choose the Fire Zinger Stacker from the Burgers section. Since you want it without sauce, I will order the Fire Zinger Stacker without sauce for you.

The available cola options are Pepsi and 7Up. I will add a Pepsi to your order. Your order is a Fire Zinger Stacker without sauce and a Pepsi. I will proceed with placing this order for you. Thank you for your order!
